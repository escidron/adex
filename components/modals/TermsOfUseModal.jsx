            <p className='mt-4'>
                In general, items purchased by, and shipped to, Buyers in U.S. locations may be subject to applicable Transaction Taxes (“Tax(es)”).Taxes are not included in the listed price for any item(s) listed by Sellers. Taxes will be separately stated and added to the listed price during
                checkout, if applicable. Tax amounts may vary based on a few factors such as the nature of the item(s) purchased, the delivery location and the tax rate in effect at the time of the transaction. The tax rate is a combined rate based on the total state and local rates of the location where the item is delivered. AdEx will collect Taxes from Buyers on behalf of Sellers where required, specifically in those states that require marketplaces to collect Taxes on behalf of Sellers. The collected Tax amounts will be reported by AdEx and remitted to the appropriate taxing authority on behalf of Sellers. Sellers are responsible for any and all Taxes except to the extent AdEx chooses or is required to calculate, collect, report and remit such Transaction Taxes according to applicable law. You hereby agree to comply with any and all applicable tax laws and regulations in connection with your use of the Service, including reporting and payment of any taxes arising from a payment transaction or income received through sales made through the Service. AdEx may request certain information from you to comply with IRS reporting requirements, including but not limited to, completing W-9 taxpayer identification forms and submitting 1099-K sales reports when required to facilitate AdEx’s Tax obligations.

                    The assigned independent arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to
                    the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this or any other applicable Terms

                    Terms are void or voidable. All arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration
                    Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary
                    Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable). The AAA’s rules are available at
                    http://www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s site
                    at http://www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules
                    and procedures, you must also send a copy of the completed form to AdEx. The arbitrator will
                    decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State Delaware, including
                    recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The
                    arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Users, but is
                    bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same AdEx User to the extent required by
                    applicable law or regulation. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding and judgment on
                    the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

                    including the initial filing fee, if you are rendered an award by the arbitrator.
                    If you receive an arbitration award that is more favorable than any offer AdEx makes to resolve
                    the claim before an arbitrator was selected, then AdEx will pay User’s reasonable attorneys’ fees
                    (not to exceed the actual amount of attorney&apos;s fees incurred by User) in addition to any
                    substantive award. AdEx will not seek its attorney&apos;s fees and costs in arbitration unless the
                    arbitrator determines that User’s claim is frivolous.
