    answer: "ADEX provides users with tools to connect and inquire about listings. ADEX brings value to the marketplace by connecting buyers and sellers. We ask that all bookings are executed through our service (website or App). We understand that in-person contact may be required to fully vet the booking location or event.

    question: "What is the booking fee?",
    answer:
      "ADEX charges a sales/booking fee of 10% to be paid by the seller. This fee is ONLY applied when a listing is booked and payment is received from the buyer. The 10% is automatically deducted from the seller’s total sales/booking price. For example, if the sales/booking amount is $100, 10%, (in this case $10) is deducted and paid to ADEX. The seller would receive $90 for the sale.",
